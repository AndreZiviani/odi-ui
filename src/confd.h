/*
 * confd — a web configuration UI for the ODI DFP-34X-2C2 (Realtek RTL9601D).
 *
 * Runs alongside the vendor's boa on its own port. It does not replace boa and
 * does not try to: boa's UI is 88 handlers compiled into the boa binary with no
 * CGI seam to hook, so the only way to extend it is to not use it.
 *
 * The design that makes this small: serve a static page and a JSON API, and let
 * the browser render. The device's configuration is ~184 MIB keys plus a couple
 * of indexed tables, described by a schema file rather than by C, so adding a
 * key is a data change and not a new handler.
 *
 * Values are emitted as the literal text `flash` printed. Nothing is parsed to
 * a number and formatted back, which is why a freestanding build with no libc
 * costs nothing here.
 *
 * This header carries what every translation unit needs: the paths it reads and
 * the two ports it binds. Everything else lives behind its own header.
