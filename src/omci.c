/*
 * Reading the OMCI MIB — the OLT's own description of the service it has
 * provisioned on this ONU.
 *
 * This is the half of the device the config page cannot show. The keys in
 * `flash` are what WE asked for; the MIB is what the line actually built, and
 * when those two disagree the MIB is right. Nearly every "O5 but no traffic"
 * report on this hardware is settled by two of these tables, which is why they
 * have a page rather than a shell command.
 *
 * Three properties hold everything here together:
 *
 *   - It is read-only. No route reaches `omcicli mib set`.
 *   - Nothing derived from the request is ever concatenated into a command.
 *     run_to_buf_ex execve()s omcicli directly, so there is no shell to quote
 *     for -- but the arguments are still domain-checked, so a bad one fails as
 *     "not a MIB table" here instead of as whatever omcicli makes of it.
 *   - The output is returned verbatim. Every attribute this firmware prints is
 *     laid out differently from the last, and a parser in C would have to be
 *     rebuilt for each one; the browser can afford to be permissive, and the
 *     raw view is worth having on its own.
