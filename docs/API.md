# API reference

Quick reference for `confd`'s HTTP API. Every write route also validates and
authenticates as described in [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md#authentication) — this
page is the wire contract, not the rationale. See `DESIGN.md` for why each
route behaves the way it does.

Every request, before the credential is looked at, must carry a `Host` that is an
IP literal, a single label or a private suffix (`.local`, `.lan`, `.home.arpa`,
`.localdomain`, `.internal`, `.localhost`, `.home`), or a name listed in
`/etc/config/confd.hosts`; anything else is `403` (DNS rebinding). A request a
browser marks `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` or `same-site` is `403` unless it is a
top-level navigation. (Browsers send `Sec-Fetch-*` only to HTTPS and
`localhost`, so over plain HTTP to the stick this rule rarely applies.)

Every route but the sign-in ones (below) needs a credential: the session cookie
a browser gets from `/api/login`, or an HTTP Basic header, which is what `curl`
and scripts send. Send Basic up front (`curl -u`, `wget --auth-no-challenge`):
the `WWW-Authenticate` challenge is sent only in answer to a Basic header that
was wrong, never to a request with no credential, so that a browser never opens
its own password dialog. Without a credential, a `GET` that accepts
`text/html` (a browser opening a page) is `303` to `/login`, anything else is
`401`. A wrong credential costs one second.

All writes refuse a cross-site `Origin`, and (for `/api/config`) read every
value back before reporting success.

## Sign in

    GET  /login                          the sign-in page (and /login.js, /style.css),
                                          no credential needed; `303` to `/` when the
                                          browser already has a live session
    POST /api/login    user=...&password=...
                                          200 `{"ok":true}` with
                                          `Set-Cookie: odi_session=<32 hex>; Path=/; HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict`;
                                          401 `{"ok":false,"error":"wrong username or password"}`
                                          after one second; 403 from another site
                                          (a foreign or `null` Origin); 500 when no
                                          random bytes could be read
    POST /api/logout                     ends the session the cookie names, clears the
                                          cookie, `303` to `/login?out=1`; any method,
                                          any Origin, no credential needed. A request
                                          with a Basic header and no session gets the
                                          old answer instead: 401 with a fresh
                                          challenge and a "Signed out" page

A session is held in RAM, 8 at most (a ninth sign-in drops the least recently
used), and ends after 30 minutes without a request, after 24 hours in all, when
confd restarts, or at sign-out. A password change through `/api/password` ends
every session but the one that made it.

## Config and values

    GET  /api/settings                  settings.tsv as JSON, [] when absent
    GET  /api/values                     current values, as the daemon's own parser sees them
    POST /api/config   key=value&key2=value2
                                          per-key result, apply class, and whether
                                          that class is a traced fact or an assumption;
                                          identity keys need `_confirm=identity`.
                                          On odi-oss also `needs` (the actions),
                                          `stock` and `interrupts` (whether the
                                          omci action drops the fibre service)
    POST /api/apply     what=network|omci|syslog|ntp|igmp
                                          apply.sh on odi-oss (`omci` signals the
                                          running omcid to reload: a VLAN change is
                                          rebuilt in place, an identity change
                                          re-registers the ONU); without it, `omci`
                                          restarts omci_app

                                          wizard marker below; and `update-check.off`
                                          (present means the page does not look for
                                          new odi-oss releases, for every browser; the
                                          look itself is made by the browser, the stick
                                          contacts nothing). `/api/firmware` reports
                                          all three under `switches`

The page's data files, each a TSV from `/etc/confd/` (or its override in
`/etc/config/confd/`) served as a JSON array of objects, one per row:

    GET  /api/schema                     keys.tsv: name, store, address, section,
                                          type, apply, writable, common;

Refused regardless of schema: `LAN_SDS_MODE`, `LAN_SPEED_MODE`, `FIBER_MODE`.

## MIB and services

    GET  /api/omci      cmd=...          `omcicli mib get` passthrough; refuses
                                          `get tables` outright (see DESIGN.md).
                                          Also refuses (403) classes 148, 157,
                                          307 and 65530, their names and `all`: they hold
                                          secrets the OLT provisioned.
                                          `me` is a class id (1-65535) or a table
                                          name (letters, digits, `_`, 39 at most);
                                          `entity` is optional hex, 1-4 digits (16
                                          bits), `0x` allowed

    GET  /api/voip                       the phone lines the OLT provisioned:

                                          or {"ok":false,"error"} with the raw text

    POST /api/voip/secrets  password=... the same view with the number, name, login and
                                          password in clear, for a caller that repeats

## Host port and safe mode (odi-oss)

    GET  /api/hostlink                    the state the image keeps, read with no fork:
                                          the host-port mode and trial
                                          (`/var/run/host-autoneg`), the link mode and
                                          trial (`serdes`: `supported` and `state`, from
                                          `/var/run/host-serdes`), the safe-mode
                                          flag for this boot and the record of an
                                          unacknowledged one, the host link;
                                          `supported` is false on an image without it
    POST /api/hostlink  action=try&mode=on|off
                        action=confirm | revert | ack
                        action=serdes-try&mode=fiber1g|2500basex|hisgmii
                        action=serdes-confirm | serdes-revert | serdes-status
                                          fixed verbs: try, confirm and revert run
                                          `host-autoneg.sh`, ack runs `safe-mode.sh ack`,
                                          the serdes-* ones run `host-serdes.sh try MODE`,
                                          `confirm`, `revert` and `status` (the mode is
                                          checked against the three names, nothing else
                                          reaches the script); bounded at 20 s. An image
                                          without the script answers
                                          `this image has no /etc/scripts/host-serdes.sh`.
                                          serdes-status also answers the script lines as
                                          `status` (`link`, `link_source`, ...): it forks
                                          (diag), so it is not part of the GET.
                                          `HOST_AUTONEG` and `HOST_SERDES` are never
                                          written by `/api/config`: only `confirm` stores
                                          them

## Management address trial (odi-oss)

    GET  /api/netaddr                     the state the image keeps (`/var/run/mgmt-addr`,
                                          read with no fork: `phase`, `trial_deadline`,
                                          `prev_ip`, `old_<KEY>`/`new_<KEY>` for the five
                                          keys, the last `event`), `uptime`, and where this
                                          request came from: `via`, the address it was sent
                                          to, and `peer`, the client. `supported` is false
                                          on an image without `mgmt-addr.sh` and in a
                                          safe-mode boot, where the keys are stored directly
    POST /api/netaddr   action=try&LAN_IP_ADDR=...&LAN_SUBNET=...
                        action=confirm | revert
                                          one of three fixed verbs, run as `mgmt-addr.sh`
                                          and bounded at 30 s. `try` takes the keys it
                                          changes (`LAN_IP_ADDR`, `LAN_SUBNET`,
                                          `LAN_ENABLE_IP2`, `LAN_IP_ADDR2`, `LAN_SUBNET2`),
                                          each checked like a write to `/api/config` (type,
                                          the pair rules, the second address not equal to the
                                          first) and then by `network.sh` itself, and answers
                                          before the address moves; the stick applies it a
                                          second later, keeps the old primary up beside it
                                          and reverts after 90 s unless confirmed.
                                          `confirm` passes the script the address and the
                                          client of THIS connection, taken from the socket:
                                          it is refused unless the request arrived on a new
                                          address, which is the proof it works, and only then
                                          are the keys stored. While the script exists
                                          `/api/config` refuses these five keys (outside a
                                          safe-mode boot), so a trial value is never in the
                                          store before it was confirmed

There is no route for the redirect. The page on the old address looks for the
new one with a `no-cors` `fetch` of `/` (`credentials: omit`, a throwaway query),
which resolves for any HTTP answer and rejects when nothing answers, so it needs
no CORS grant and sends no credential. The stick answers that fetch with `403`
and the text `cross-site request refused` before it looks at any credential (and
so without the one-second delay a failed sign-in costs); nothing else leaves the
stick. Then it navigates to the new address, a top-level navigation, which is
allowed and answers `303` to the sign-in page there: the session cookie belongs
to the old address. There is no token to hand over (DESIGN.md, "Moving the
management address").

## Setup wizard marker

The setup wizard (`web/wizard.js`) keeps one fact on the stick: whether it was
completed or skipped. It is the switch file `/etc/config/confd.setup`, next to
`confd.auth`, owned by confd and read by nothing in the image, so every browser
agrees and no odi-oss key is involved.

    GET  /api/firmware                   `"switches":{"omci-identity.on":false,"confd.setup":false,"update-check.off":false}`
    POST /api/switch  name=confd.setup&on=1|0
                                          create or remove it; `{"ok":true,"on":true}`.
                                          400 for `on` other than 0 or 1 or a name not
                                          on the allowlist, 401 without the credential, 403 from
                                          another site, as for every write

Absent by default, so a stick nobody has set up shows the wizard when the fibre
has light and the ONU is not in O5; present, the page never opens it by itself
(the Setup button in the header always does). The page writes it on every way
out of the wizard and silently when it first sees O5. A factory reset removes
it with the rest of `/etc/config`.

## Backup and reset

    GET  /api/backup                      both config stores as a file, identity included
    POST /api/reset      _confirm=reset   `flash default cs` (service store only;
                                          `hs`, the hardware identity, is not reachable here)

The route always answers plain XML. The page encrypts it in the browser when
you give a password (nothing about the password reaches the stick), and the
result is an OpenSSL `enc` file (`Salted__`, 8 salt bytes, AES-256-CBC), with the
key and IV from PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 at a fixed 200000 rounds. Without this page or
the stick, decrypt it with:

    openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 200000 -md sha256 \
        -in odi-config-backup.xml.enc -out odi-config-backup.xml

(OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later; it asks for the password.) To encrypt by hand the same
way, drop `-d` and swap the files. The count is not stored in the file, so it is
part of the format; `web/crypto.js` holds it as `ITER`.

Restoring a backup has no dedicated endpoint: the browser replays it through
`/api/config`, key by key — see DESIGN.md. The management address keys of a
backup go through `/api/netaddr` instead when the image has the trial.

## Admin

    POST /api/password   user=...&password=...
                                          user 1-64 printable characters, no space or

    GET  /api/sshkeys                     {"path":..., "keys":[{"i":0,"line":"ssh-ed25519 AAAA... comment"}]}
    POST /api/sshkeys    key=<line>       append; the type is one of ssh-ed25519,

                                          sk- type, the blob is whole base64 that
                                          parses to that same type, one printable
                                          line of at most 1000 characters; a key
                                          already in the file is refused
    POST /api/sshkeys    delete=<i>       rewrite the file without line i
